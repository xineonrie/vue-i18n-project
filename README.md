# üåê Vue 3 Multi-language Switcher Demo

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a demo built with **Vue 3 + Vite + Vuex + Capacitor** to showcase an in-app language switcher.  I selected a figma design file form the figma community, and developed a music playing app with 2 pages as an example.
Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/P3SpXlP8z7pyCn8jgEpmAW/Music-player-App-Design-%7C-Free-to-use--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=dKRlH3cWzBSBFXIY-0

It demonstrates:
- Runtime language switching without rebuilding the app
- Initial language setup via URL query parameter
- Persistent language preference across sessions
- Consistent support on Web, iOS, and Android (via Capacitor)
- Lazy-loading and code-splitting for large translation files
- Basic accessibility support
